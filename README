sfetch - suckless fetching utility
--------------------
sfetch is a simple fetching utility that suck less compared to fastfetch and neofetch. It uses rust as a programming language in order to be safe from buffer overflows and any vulnerability, it also is universal because it can be compiled any where, unlike fetcher, which can not.

the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st

Use /usr/local/bin/sfetch or use the $PATH variable: sfetch.
